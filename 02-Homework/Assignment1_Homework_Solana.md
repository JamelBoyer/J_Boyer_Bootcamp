## Overview

Solana Labs (SOL), dubbed as the “Ethereum (Eth) killer” in the cryptocurrency community is an open source permissionless blockchain. Below is a case study on the blockchain and its founder plans to lead the way to mass adoption by addressing issues like transaction fees, validation speeds, and scalability.

## How it all started

“As the legend goes, Anatoly had two coffees and a beer and came up with the idea of Proof of History.” He published a Whitepaper describing Proof of History (POH) in November 2017. He recruited former colleagues as co-founders. Greg Fitzgerald created the first prototype and Stephen Akridge who made improvements to the verification process. They name the company Solana after a beach town where the three lived and surfed together.

## Motivation Behind SOL

Anatoly sought a way to transfer information in a decentralized manner more quickly than the NASDQ which can handle 250,000 transactions per second (tps). He loathed the idea that industry controlled the flow of information and funds. If Anatoly could find a way to move information along as instantly as the NASDQ, it could level the playing field by eliminating intermediaries, fees and restrictive access to money. (Nasdaq takes in $800k in fees per day).

## Technology

Time discrepancies, timestamps, and more nodes validating transactions slow down blockchains such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Eth. As a result, they perform approx. 15 tps. Compared to Visa which can do 65,000tps. POH solves this dilemma and enables SOL to handle transactions between 45000 and 65000tps.  “These impressive tps numbers are made possible by its novel proof of state census mechanism which timestamp transactions using POH.”

## Tokenomics

<!-- UL -->
* Supply Cap: 489 million
* Token: SOL. 47.6% of tokens were distributed to seeding, founding, and team members; remaining have been releasing to the public.
* Incentives: Staking that automatically compounds interest.
* Inflation: SOL has an initial inflation rate of 8% - descends yearly into a long-term outlook of 1.5%.

## Competitors

<!-- UL -->

* Eth (slow transaction speeds)
* Avalanche (AVAX) – older application not as profitable
* Terra (Luna) - SOL is ten times faster
* Fantom (FTM) - lost its chief developer Andre Cronje

<!-- Italics -->
*Aside from Luna’s incredible yield, SOL outperforms them all.*

## SOL Stumbles?

Over the past year, the block chain has been down four times as a result of someone spamming transactions (DDoS attack). Then there is the Wormhole attack. An attacker created false instructions using open-source code about the operation of transfers with Eth. The attacker stole in excess of 300m in crypto but received 10m from SOL and returned the money. The business almost got destroyed.
